# Gaussian-Transformation

Some machine learning models like linear and logistic regression assume that the variables are normally distributed. Others benefit from "Gaussian-like" distributions, as in such distributions the observations of X available to predict Y vary across a greater range of values. Thus, Gaussian distributed variables may boost the machine learning algorithm performance.

Various Transformations to change the distribution of features:

1. Log Transformation
2. Square root Transformation
3. Reciprocal Transformation
4. Exponential Transformation
5. Box-Cox Transformation
