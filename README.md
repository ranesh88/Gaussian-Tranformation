# Gaussian-Transformation

Some machine learning models like linear and logistic regression assume that the variables are normally distributed. Others benefit from "Gaussian-like" distributions, as in such distributions the observations of X available to predict Y vary across a greater range of values. Thus, Gaussian distributed variables may boost the machine learning algorithm performance.
